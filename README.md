# A Simple Restaurant Data Analysis

## What I Learned

This project helped me understand fundamental SQL operations and how to apply them to real-world datasets. I am now more confident in using SQL to analyze and derive insights from structured data.

- Basic SQL keywords like `WHERE`, `SELECT`, `FROM`, `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, and `HAVING`.
- How to filter and sort data using `WHERE` and `ORDER BY` clauses.
- Combining data from multiple tables using `JOIN`.
- Aggregating data using functions like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, and `GROUP BY`.
- Understanding and applying subqueries.

## Project Description

This practice involves analyzing restaurant data to extract insights using SQL queries. The dataset contains information about menu items, orders, customers, and staff. Various SQL techniques were applied to generate reports, identify trends, and summarize key metrics.

## SQL Queries Implemented

- **Filtering and Sorting Data**: Filtered specific menu items based on customer orders and sorted them by quantity.
  
- **Aggregating Data**: Calculated total revenue per menu item, average order value, and identified best-selling items.
  
- **Join Operations**: Joined data from the two tables to analyze order history.
